          <p>In this document, I will take you through the steps needed to put your PC together from scratch. I will take into account brands such as <strong>AMD</strong> and <strong>Intel</strong> as there can be slight differences in how to assemble certain parts.</p>
          <p>Certain CPU's will only work with certain motherboard sockets and chipsets depending on if you chose to get an Intel or AMD CPU. For instance, if you chose a <strong>7000 series CPU</strong> such as the <strong>AMD 7900x</strong> you would need an <strong>x670, x670E or B650E.</strong> To help you know which motherboard is compatible you can visit websites such as <a id="PartPicker" href="https://uk.pcpartpicker.com"><strong>PC Part Picker</strong></a>, add the CPU of your choice to the selection in the builder then select motherboards. From here it will automatically bring up motherboards compatible with the chosen CPU.</p>
          <p>This can seem very daunting at first but you'll soon find it's a lot less complicated than you expected. Not only will you now have more control over the components in your PC and be able to save a lot more money in certain areas compared to a pre built but you will also get an idea as to how it all works.</p>

          <header><h2>First Steps:</h2></header>
            <p>To start off a common practice is to start with the CPU, motherboard and ram as it's easier to assemble now as opposed to when it's in the case. Before you start you need to make sure you are grounded. This is to prevent the buildup and discharge of static electricity potentially damage these components.</p>
            <p>To ground yourself you can:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Use an ESD Wrist Strap:</strong> An ESD wrist strap is a device that you wear around your wrist, with the other end connected to a metal part of the PC case. This helps to discharge static electricity from your body to the case, keeping the components safe.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Work on a Static-Free Surface:</strong> If you don't have an ESD wrist strap, work on a static-free surface like an anti-static mat or an uncovered wooden table. Avoid working on carpeted floors or surfaces that could generate static.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Handle Components by the Edges:</strong> When handling sensitive components like CPUs, RAM modules, and graphics cards, touch them only by the edges. Avoid touching the gold pins or contacts.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Ground Yourself Frequently:</strong> Even if you're using an ESD wrist strap, it's a good practice to touch the metal part of the PC case periodically to equalize any charge that might have built up on your body. You can also do this by touching a radiator(Make sure it's not hot first)</li>
  
  <li><strong>Avoid unnecessary movement:</strong> While working on the PC, try to minimize unnecessary movement, as movement can generate static electricity.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Take the motherboard out of it's static free wrap and place it on top of the cardboard box for the motherboard. Let's get started in assembling the PC.</p>

          <header><h2>Assembling the parts:<h2></header>
            <h3 id="CPU">CPU</h3>
            <p id="CPU"><strong>Intel</strong> To install an intel CPU release the retention arm on the CPU socket on the motherboard by pressing it and lifting it to the side, and then lift it all the way up. The socket will move slightly during thos motion. This is fine. Remove the plastic bracket and place it to the side. From here take the CPU and make sure you're looking at the top side. You'll see a golden triangle in one of the corners. This will line up with an arrow indent on the motherboard. Use this triangle and the notches on either side of the CPU to line up the processor then gently lower it into the socket. This will fit smoothly without force. If you're in doubt just remove it and try again - Be careful not to bend the pins.</p>
            <p id="CPU"><strong>AMD</strong> To install an AMD CPU release the retention arm on the CPU socket on the motherboard by lifting the arm. Remove the plastic bracket and place it to the side. Look at the underside of your CPU for a golden triangle. This will line up with an arrow indent on the motherboard. Carefully place it into the socket, making sure that all of the pins go into their corresponding ports. Similar to intel this will fit smoothly without force. If you're in doubt just remove it and try again - Be careful not to bend the pins.</p>
            <h3 id="CPU-cooler">Installing the CPU cooler</h3>
            <h4 id="air-cooler">Air Cooler</h4>
              <p id="CPU-cooler">Similarly to the CPU, installing the cooler onto the motherboard is often easier to do outside the case so keep the motherboard on top of that cardboard box for now. The first thing you will need for both AIO and Air coolers is Thermal Paste. The paste is very important.</p>
          <ol class="CPU-cooler">
            <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Brackets and Backplate</strong> The first step is to install the correct bracket for your cooler. The type of bracket you need will depend on the socket of your motherboard. Most CPU cooler manufacturers include brackets for different socket types. Install the backplate on the back of the motherboard, providing the screw holes the cooler needs. Secure it by installing the standoffs on the front</li>
              <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Apply Thermal paste.</strong> Some coolers come with Thermal paste already applied at the bottom of the cooler. If this is the case for yours then you can skip this step. Apply thermal paste on your CPU, if needed. A small amount, just enough to cover the metal surface of the CPU with a paper-thin layer, will suffice. Be careful not to use too much as this can hinder performance</li>
               <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Mount the cooler.</strong> Line up your CPU cooler by holding it over the CPU and carefully aligning it with the holes on the motherboard or the standoffs you installed earlier. Depending on your cooler, you may need to remove the fans from the heatsink to align and install it properly. Secure the CPU cooler by gradually tightening the screws using an X-shaped pattern. Start loosely, then increase tension with each pass. This helps create even pressure on the CPU's integrated heat spreader, facilitating easier installation and even spreading of the thermal paste.</li>
               <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Reattach any removed fans.</strong>If you removed any fans from your cooler earlier, you can attach them to your cooler now. Make sure they're pulling and pushing air in the same direction. Installing them in the wrong direction can result in poor thermal performance. Remember to keep the fan oriented so that it blows towards the left side of the motherboard – this will help make sure the hot air wafts towards the rear of your eventual PC, where it can be pumped out by an exhaust fan.</li>
                <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Connect the cable</strong> By this point you should have a fully mounted CPU cooler with, presumably, a suitably spread-out layer of paste between it and the CPU. All that’s left to do is connect the fan to the motherboard, so grab the fan’s cable and plug it into the 4-pin CPU_FAN header on the mobo. This is usually found along the board's top edge, or next to the CPU socket further down.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>AIO cooler</h4>
          <ol>
            <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Brackets and Backplate</strong> First, install the backplate on the motherboard. Most cases come with a cutout at the back that allows you to install the backplate without having to remove the motherboard. If you're building a new computer, it's a good idea to install the backplate before building the rest of the PC</li>
            <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Install the Fans</strong> Next, install the fans on the radiator. It's easier to do this before installing the radiator. You'll find long screws in your AIO kit for this purpose. Make sure you've confirmed the direction of airflow for the fans before installing them.</li>
            <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Mount the AIO Water Cooler</strong> Mount the AIO water cooler by screwing the pump to the backplate using the bracket included in the package. Insert the bracket's mounting points into the given holes and screw them firmly in place, ensuring that the pressure is evenly distributed across the CPU surface</li>
            <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Install the Radiator</strong> After the fans are in place, it's time to install the radiator in your PC case. Most cases have built-in mounting points for the radiator. Place the radiator inside the case and secure it using the screws provided with the package</li>
            <li class="CPU-cooler"><strong>Connect the Wires</strong> Finally, you need to connect the wires. The fan and the water block of the AIO cooler have separate cables, one for the power and one for the ARGB signal. Connect the water block’s ARGB signal cable to the 5V 3 PIN position on the motherboard. The power cable on the water cooling row should be connected to the AIO_PUMP on the motherboard, and the power cable on the fan should be connected to the CHA_FAN position on the motherboard </li>
