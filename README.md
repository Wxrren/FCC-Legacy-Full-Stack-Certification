# FCC-Responsive-Web-Design---Project1
I'm completing the Free course camp Responsive Web Design Certification. I'll be aiming to learn how to use webpages as well as learning the languages HTML and CSS.

This project repository will have each of the 5 courses required to get the first ceritifaction Project. This includes:

*Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App
*Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu
*Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers
*Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form

The final project is the certification project which is the survey form.
This is one of the required projects to earn my certification.

For this project, I will build a survey form to collect data from  users.

I will post my progress here so my projects can be seen.
