# FCC-Legacy-Full-Stack-Certification

Welcome to the repository for my FreeCodeCamp Legacy Full Stack Certification projects! Here, you'll find the projects I completed as part of the certification program.

## Project Overview

The certification program consists of seven courses that cover a variety of skills such as HTML and CSS fundamentals, Javascript, Back End Development and APIs. Each course focuses on building a specific web application. Each of the 7 core courses has multiple different projects that once all completed provide you with a certification in each course. The projects included in this repository are:

1. [Responsive Web Design](https://github.com/Wxrren/FCC-Legacy-Full-Stack-Certification/tree/main/Responsive%20Web%20Design)
2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
3. Front End Development Libraries
4. Data Visualization
5. Back End Development and APIs
6. Legacy Information Security and Quality Assurance

## Project Progress

Throughout my learning journey, I will be posting my project progress in this repository. Each course will have it's own folder. Within those folders you will find the projects split into folders for each section of that particular course. The read me file in each course folder will help you navigate to view the different projects completed. You can follow along and see the evolution of my projects as I complete each course and work on the certification project.
