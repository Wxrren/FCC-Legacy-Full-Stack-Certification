# FCC-Responsive-Web-Design---Project1

Welcome to the repository for my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification projects! Here, you'll find the projects I completed as part of the certification program.

## Project Overview

The certification program consists of five courses that cover HTML and CSS fundamentals. Each course focuses on building a specific web application. The projects included in this repository are:

1. Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App
2. Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu
3. Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers
4. Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form
5. Survey Form (Certification Project)

## Certification Project: Survey Form

The final project for the certification is the Survey Form. The objective of this project is to design and implement a survey form to collect data from users. I will be using my HTML and CSS skills to create a user-friendly and visually appealing survey form.

## Project Progress

Throughout my learning journey, I will be posting my project progress in this repository. You can follow along and see the evolution of my projects as I complete each course and work on the certification project.
