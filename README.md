CC-Responsive-Web-Design---Project1
Welcome to the repository for my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification projects! Here, you'll find the projects I completed as part of the certification program.

Project Overview
The certification program consists of five courses that cover HTML and CSS fundamentals. Each course focuses on building a specific web application. The projects included in this repository are:

Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App
Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu
Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers
Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form
Survey Form (Certification Project)
Certification Project: Survey Form
The final project for the certification is the Survey Form. The objective of this project is to design and implement a survey form to collect data from users. I will be using my HTML and CSS skills to create a user-friendly and visually appealing survey form.

Project Progress
Throughout my learning journey, I will be posting my project progress in this repository. You can follow along and see the evolution of my projects as I complete each course and work on the certification project.
