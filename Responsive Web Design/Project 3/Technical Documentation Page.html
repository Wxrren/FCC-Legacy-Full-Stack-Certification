          <p>In this document, I will take you through the steps needed to put your PC together from scratch. I will take into account brands such as <strong>AMD</strong> and <strong>Intel</strong> as there can be slight differences in how to assemble certain parts.</p>
          <p>Certain CPU's will only work with certain motherboard sockets and chipsets depending on if you chose to get an Intel or AMD CPU. For instance, if you chose a <strong>7000 series CPU</strong> such as the <strong>AMD 7900x</strong> you would need an <strong>x670, x670E or B650E.</strong> To help you know which motherboard is compatible you can visit websites such as <a id="PartPicker" href="https://uk.pcpartpicker.com"><strong>PC Part Picker</strong></a>, add the CPU of your choice to the selection in the builder then select motherboards. From here it will automatically bring up motherboards compatible with the chosen CPU.</p>
          <p>This can seem very daunting at first but you'll soon find it's a lot less complicated than you expected. Not only will you now have more control over the components in your PC and be able to save a lot more money in certain areas compared to a pre built but you will also get an idea as to how it all works.</p>

          <header><h2>First Steps:</h2></header>
            <p>To start off a common practice is to start with the CPU, motherboard and ram as it's easier to assemble now as opposed to when it's in the case. Before you start you need to make sure you are grounded. This is to prevent the buildup and discharge of static electricity potentially damage these components.</p>
            <p>To ground yourself you can:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Use an ESD Wrist Strap:</strong> An ESD wrist strap is a device that you wear around your wrist, with the other end connected to a metal part of the PC case. This helps to discharge static electricity from your body to the case, keeping the components safe.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Work on a Static-Free Surface:</strong> If you don't have an ESD wrist strap, work on a static-free surface like an anti-static mat or an uncovered wooden table. Avoid working on carpeted floors or surfaces that could generate static.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Handle Components by the Edges:</strong> When handling sensitive components like CPUs, RAM modules, and graphics cards, touch them only by the edges. Avoid touching the gold pins or contacts.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Ground Yourself Frequently:</strong> Even if you're using an ESD wrist strap, it's a good practice to touch the metal part of the PC case periodically to equalize any charge that might have built up on your body. You can also do this by touching a radiator(Make sure it's not hot first)</li>
  
  <li><strong>Avoid unnecessary movement:</strong> While working on the PC, try to minimize unnecessary movement, as movement can generate static electricity.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Take the motherboard out of it's static free wrap and place it on top of the cardboard box for the motherboard. Let's get started in assembling the PC.</p>

            <p id="CPU"><strong>Intel</strong> To install an intel CPU release the retention arm on the CPU socket on the motherboard by pressing it and lifting it to the side, and then lift it all the way up. The socket will move slightly during thos motion. This is fine. Remove the plastic bracket and place it to the side. From here take the CPU and make sure you're looking at the top side. You'll see a golden triangle in one of the corners. This will line up with an arrow indent on the motherboard. Use this triangle and the notches on either side of the CPU to line up the processor then gently lower it into the socket. This will fit smoothly without force. If you're in doubt just remove it and try again - Be careful not to bend the pins.</p>
            <p id="CPU"><strong>AMD</strong> To install an AMD CPU release the retention arm on the CPU socket on the motherboard by lifting the arm. Remove the plastic bracket and place it to the side. Look at the underside of your CPU for a golden triangle. This will line up with an arrow indent on the motherboard. Carefully place it into the socket, making sure that all of the pins go into their corresponding ports. Similar to intel this will fit smoothly without force. If you're in doubt just remove it and try again - Be careful not to bend the pins.</p>
