          <header><h1>Introduction</h1></header>
          <p>In this document, I will take you through the steps needed to put your PC together from scratch. I will take into account brands such as <strong>AMD</strong> and <strong>Intel</strong> as there can be slight differences in how to assemble certain parts.</p>
          <p>Certain CPU's will only work with certain motherboard sockets and chipsets depending on if you chose to get an Intel or AMD CPU. For instance, if you chose a <strong>7000 series CPU</strong> such as the <strong>AMD 7900x</strong> you would need an <strong>x670, x670E or B650E.</strong> To help you know which motherboard is compatible you can visit websites such as <a id="PartPicker" href="https://uk.pcpartpicker.com"><strong>PC Part Picker</strong></a>, add the CPU of your choice to the selection in the builder then select motherboards. From here it will automatically bring up motherboards compatible with the chosen CPU.</p>
          <p>This can seem very daunting at first but you'll soon find it's a lot less complicated than you expected. Not only will you now have more control over the components in your PC and be able to save a lot more money in certain areas compared to a pre built but you will also get an idea as to how it all works.</p>

          <header><h2>First Steps</h2></header>
            <p>To start off a common practice is to start with the CPU, motherboard and ram as it's easier to assemble now as opposed to when it's in the case. Before you start you need to make sure you are grounded. This is to prevent the buildup and discharge of static electricity potentially damage these components.</p>
            <p>To ground yourself you can:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Use an ESD Wrist Strap:</strong> An ESD wrist strap is a device that you wear around your wrist, with the other end connected to a metal part of the PC case. This helps to discharge static electricity from your body to the case, keeping the components safe.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Work on a Static-Free Surface:</strong> If you don't have an ESD wrist strap, work on a static-free surface like an anti-static mat or an uncovered wooden table. Avoid working on carpeted floors or surfaces that could generate static.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Handle Components by the Edges:</strong> When handling sensitive components like CPUs, RAM modules, and graphics cards, touch them only by the edges. Avoid touching the gold pins or contacts.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Ground Yourself Frequently:</strong> Even if you're using an ESD wrist strap, it's a good practice to touch the metal part of the PC case periodically to equalize any charge that might have built up on your body. You can also do this by touching a radiator(Make sure it's not hot first)</li>
  
  <li><strong>Avoid unnecessary movement:</strong> While working on the PC, try to minimize unnecessary movement, as movement can generate static electricity.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Take the motherboard out of it's static free wrap and place it on top of the cardboard box for the motherboard. Let's get started in assembling the PC.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Assembling_the_parts">
          <header><h2>Assembling the parts<h2></header>
            <h3>CPU</h3>
            <p><strong>Intel</strong> To install an intel CPU release the retention arm on the CPU socket on the motherboard by pressing it and lifting it to the side, and then lift it all the way up. The socket will move slightly during thos motion. This is fine. Remove the plastic bracket and place it to the side. From here take the CPU and make sure you're looking at the top side. You'll see a golden triangle in one of the corners. This will line up with an arrow indent on the motherboard. Use this triangle and the notches on either side of the CPU to line up the processor then gently lower it into the socket. This will fit smoothly without force. If you're in doubt just remove it and try again - Be careful not to bend the pins.</p>
            <p  id="CPU"><strong>AMD</strong> To install an AMD CPU release the retention arm on the CPU socket on the motherboard by lifting the arm. Remove the plastic bracket and place it to the side. Look at the underside of your CPU for a golden triangle. This will line up with an arrow indent on the motherboard. Carefully place it into the socket, making sure that all of the pins go into their corresponding ports. Similar to intel this will fit smoothly without force. If you're in doubt just remove it and try again - Be careful not to bend the pins.</p>
            <h3>Installing the CPU cooler</h3>
            <h4 id="air-cooler">Air Cooler</h4>
              <p>Similarly to the CPU, installing the cooler onto the motherboard is often easier to do outside the case so keep the motherboard on top of that cardboard box for now. The first thing you will need for both AIO and Air coolers is Thermal Paste. The paste is very important.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Brackets and Backplate</strong> The first step is to install the correct bracket for your cooler. The type of bracket you need will depend on the socket of your motherboard. Most CPU cooler manufacturers include brackets for different socket types. Install the backplate on the back of the motherboard, providing the screw holes the cooler needs. Secure it by installing the standoffs on the front</li>
              <li><strong>Apply Thermal paste.</strong> Some coolers come with Thermal paste already applied at the bottom of the cooler. If this is the case for yours then you can skip this step. Apply thermal paste on your CPU, if needed. A small amount, just enough to cover the metal surface of the CPU with a paper-thin layer, will suffice. Be careful not to use too much as this can hinder performance</li>
               <li><strong>Mount the cooler.</strong> Line up your CPU cooler by holding it over the CPU and carefully aligning it with the holes on the motherboard or the standoffs you installed earlier. Depending on your cooler, you may need to remove the fans from the heatsink to align and install it properly. Secure the CPU cooler by gradually tightening the screws using an X-shaped pattern. Start loosely, then increase tension with each pass. This helps create even pressure on the CPU's integrated heat spreader, facilitating easier installation and even spreading of the thermal paste.</li>
               <li><strong>Reattach any removed fans.</strong>If you removed any fans from your cooler earlier, you can attach them to your cooler now. Make sure they're pulling and pushing air in the same direction. Installing them in the wrong direction can result in poor thermal performance. Remember to keep the fan oriented so that it blows towards the left side of the motherboard – this will help make sure the hot air wafts towards the rear of your eventual PC, where it can be pumped out by an exhaust fan.</li>
                <li><strong>Connect the cable</strong> By this point you should have a fully mounted CPU cooler with, presumably, a suitably spread-out layer of paste between it and the CPU. All that’s left to do is connect the fan to the motherboard, so grab the fan’s cable and plug it into the 4-pin CPU_FAN header on the mobo. This is usually found along the board's top edge, or next to the CPU socket further down.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>AIO cooler</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Brackets and Backplate</strong> First, install the backplate on the motherboard. Most cases come with a cutout at the back that allows you to install the backplate without having to remove the motherboard. If you're building a new computer, it's a good idea to install the backplate before building the rest of the PC</li>
            <li><strong>Install the Fans</strong> Next, install the fans on the radiator. It's easier to do this before installing the radiator. You'll find long screws in your AIO kit for this purpose. Make sure you've confirmed the direction of airflow for the fans before installing them.</li>
            <li><strong>Mount the AIO Water Cooler</strong> Mount the AIO water cooler by screwing the pump to the backplate using the bracket included in the package. Insert the bracket's mounting points into the given holes and screw them firmly in place, ensuring that the pressure is evenly distributed across the CPU surface</li>
            <li><strong>Install the Radiator</strong> After the fans are in place, it's time to install the radiator in your PC case. You can do this step before you install the motherboard or after. If might be slightly fidgety doing it before. I would reccomend doing it after installing the motherboard for the easist experience. Most cases have built-in mounting points for the radiator. Place the radiator inside the case and secure it using the screws provided with the package</li>
            <li id="CPU-cooler"><strong>Connect the Wires</strong> Finally, you need to connect the wires. The fan and the water block of the AIO cooler have separate cables, one for the power and one for the ARGB signal. Connect the water block’s ARGB signal cable to the 5V 3 PIN position on the motherboard. The power cable on the water cooling row should be connected to the AIO_PUMP on the motherboard, and the power cable on the fan should be connected to the CHA_FAN position on the motherboard </li>
          </ol>
          <h3><strong>Installing the motherboard</strong></h3>
            <p> Now it's time to install the motherboard. This is an easy process but can be slightly fidgety at times. Don't worry, it's all part of the fun. Please note that if you have an m.2 SSD it might be easier to install this outside of the case before putting the motherboard in. If that's the case, feel free to skip to that section and then come back here to install the motherboard. </p> 
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Install the Standoffs</strong> Before installing the motherboard, you need to install the standoffs in your PC case. These are small metal pegs that prevent the motherboard from touching the case, which could cause a short circuit. The standoffs should align with the screw holes on your motherboard</li>
               <li><strong> Install the I/O Shield</strong> Some motherboards have one built in so if that's the case for you, you can skip this step! The I/O shield is a plate that protects the motherboard's rear ports. It usually comes with the motherboard. Press it into the rear gap in your case, ensuring the correct orientation</li>
                <li><strong>Place the Motherboard</strong> Carefully lower the motherboard onto the standoffs, aligning the screw holes on the motherboard with the standoffs. Also, ensure the ports on the motherboard fit into the cutouts on the I/O shield(unless you have one built into the board itself, then just fit it securely) Use the screws that came with your case to secure the motherboard to the standoffs. Don't overtighten the screws; you want the motherboard to be secure but not under excessive pressure</li>
                 <li><strong>Connect the Power Supply cables</strong>Connect the power supply cables to the motherboard. Typically, there are two connectors: a 24-pin connector and a 4 or 8-pin 12V connector. The locations can vary, so refer to your motherboard manual for guidance. Once connect make sure to fit the other end of the cables through to the back of your PC. These will be connected to the power supply when we install that next.</li>
                 <li  id="motherboard"><strong>Connect your cables</strong> Track the cables that come from the front panel of your CPU case. These cables include the power LED lights indicator cable, which will have a + and - sign at the end, and the hard disk LED indicator. Search for writings like F_PANEL, JFP1, or FP1 on your motherboard. These indicate the front panel headers where you'll connect the cables. If you have trouble finding these headers, refer to your motherboard's user manual. Connect the front panel cables to the headers on your motherboard. Make sure you connect the positive and negative ends of the LED cables to the correct pins on the front panel header. The power and reset button cables can be inserted in any way, as they have no polarity .</li>
            </ol>
             <h3>Installing your HDD/SSD</h3>
              <p> Now is probably a good time to install your hardrives before we go any further.
              </p>
              <h4>M.2 SSD</h4>
              <ol>
                 <li><strong>Remove Packaging/plastics</strong> Remove the M.2 SSD from its packaging, touching only the sides of the drive to avoid damaging the circuitry. Make sure the SSD and connector match up</li>
                 <li><strong>Connect to the motherboard</strong> Carefully insert the M.2 SSD into the slot at a 30-degree angle. Once inserted, it should stay at that angle; there is a slight spring, which you'll see if you push the other end down toward the motherboard. Secure the SSD by pressing it against the motherboard, lining up the screw hole in the SSD with the standoff, and tightening the screw. Don't overtighten the screws; you want the SSD to be secure but not under excessive pressure.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>SATA SSD</h4>
               <ol>
                 <li><strong>Mount the SSD in the Drive Bay</strong> Hold the SSD with the connectors facing towards the back of the case. Align the screw holes on the SSD with the corresponding holes in the drive bay. Using screws or brackets provided with your SSD, carefully fasten the SSD to the drive bay. Make sure it is firmly attached and won’t move or come loose during use</li>
                 <li><strong> Connect the Data and Power Cables</strong> Locate the SATA ports on your motherboard. Take one end of the SATA data cable and connect it to an available SATA port on the motherboard. Ensure a secure connection by pushing the cable gently but firmly into the port. Connect the other end of the SATA data cable to the corresponding SATA port on the SSD. Ensure it is securely connected and properly aligned robots.net. Next, locate a spare power cable from your power supply unit (PSU) or use a SATA power cable. Connect one end to the SSD’s power port and the other end to an available power connector from the PSU. As the power supply isn't connected yet, trail the cables to where the power supply will go similar to the motherboard cables.</li>
              </ol>
               <h4>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</h4>
                 <ol>
                 <li><strong>Mount the HHD in the Drive Bay</strong> Hold the HDD with the connectors facing towards the back of the case. Align the screw holes on the HDD with the corresponding holes in the drive bay. Using screws or brackets provided with your HDD, carefully fasten the HDD to the drive bay. Make sure it is firmly attached and won’t move or come loose during use</li>
                 <li id="hardrive"><strong> Connect the Data and Power Cables</strong> Locate the SATA ports on your motherboard. Take one end of the SATA data cable and connect it to an available SATA port on the motherboard. Ensure a secure connection by pushing the cable gently but firmly into the port. Connect the other end of the SATA data cable to the corresponding SATA port on the HDD. Ensure it is securely connected and properly aligned computerhope.com.
Next, locate a spare power cable from your power supply unit (PSU) or use a SATA power cable. Connect one end to the HDD’s power port and the other end to an available power connector from the PSU. As the power supply isn't connected yet, trail the cables to where the power supply will go similar to the motherboard cables.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Installing your Power Supply (PSU)</h3>
              <p">Now with all these cables that need powering up installed, it's probably best we give them something to connect to.</p>
              <ol>
                 <li><strong>Prepare the Power Supply</strong> If you have a modular or semi-modular PSU, plug in all the necessary cables before installing it in your computer case. If you have a standard, non-modular power supply, you can skip this step. The cables you'll need include a 24-pin power connector for the motherboard, a CPU power connector, PCIe power connectors for the graphics card, and peripheral power connectors (MOLEX and SATA) for your storage drives and other peripherals</li>
                 <li><strong> Install the PSU in the Case</strong> Position the PSU in its designated location in the PC case, ensuring the power supply fan aligns with the ventilation cutout in the case. In most instances, you have to simply place the PSU with its fan facing downwards. Once positioned correctly, proceed to screw in the power supply in the PC case, using the screws that came with the PSU</li>
                 <li><strong> Connect the Power Supply to the Motherboard</strong> Find the main power cable on the power supply (usually the one with the largest plug) and attach it to the long, rectangular port on the motherboard. Then, attach the secondary power cable to the motherboard. Depending on your power supply and motherboard, you may not have a secondary power cable. The plug used to attach the power supply to the motherboard is usually a 20- or 24-pin connector</li>
                 <li  id="PSU"><strong> Connect the Power Supply to Other Computer Components</strong> sing the smaller cables, connect the power supply to your computer's hard drive, CD drive, and graphics card. If you have other components in your case (e.g., a lighting system), you may need to plug these in as well</li>
              </ol>
              <h3 id="GPU">Installing your graphics card</h3>
              <p id="GPU">Congratulations! We are nearly at the end and your PC should be starting to take shape. I decided to leave the best component for last. It's time to install your graphics card.</p>
              <ol id="GPU">
                 <li><strong>Remove the Dummy Bracket (If Any)</strong> If your PC case has a dummy bracket or PCIe slot cover in the spot where the graphics card will be installed, remove it by unscrewing it from the case. Set the dummy bracket aside as you may need it if you remove the graphics card in the futur</li>
                 <li><strong> Insert the Graphics Card</strong> Locate the PCIe x16 slot on your motherboard. It's usually the longest PCIe slot and is positioned close to the CPU. Gently align the graphics card with the slot, making sure the gold contacts on the bottom of the card are facing down and the ports on the card align with the slot opening. Insert the graphics card evenly and firmly into the slot until you hear a click and the card is securely seated. Be careful not to force it</li>
                 <li><strong> Secure the Graphics Card</strong> Once the graphics card is properly inserted, secure it to the case using the screws provided. Usually, there will be one or two screws on the bracket at the back of the graphics card. Align the screw holes on the bracket with those on the case and tighten the screws to hold the card firmly in place.</li>
                 <li><strong> Connect the Power Supply to Other Computer Components</strong> Locate the appropriate power connectors on your graphics card. These are usually six-pin or eight-pin connectors located on the side or top edge of the card. Connect the PCIe power cables from your power supply unit (PSU) to the corresponding power connectors on the graphics card. For six-pin connectors, use the appropriate six-pin PCIe power cables. For eight-pin connectors, use either the appropriate eight-pin PCIe power cables or a six-pin connector from the PSU plus a two-pin adapter.</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Tidying_cables_and_finish">
          <header><h2>Tidying cables and finish</h2></header>
            <p>Okay, the next bit is not as fun but is very important to giving your PC a nice and clean aesthetic. We're going to tidy up the cables on the front and the back. By now everything you need should be plugged in. Here are some tips to getting your cables organised.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Use cable ties or Velcro straps:</strong> Secure the cables together using cable ties or Velcro straps. These can be found at any electronics store. Bundle cables of similar types together, such as power supply cables, SATA cables, and front panel cables. This will make it easier to manage and identify specific cables in the future. Avoid tying the cables too tightly to allow for easy adjustments later if needed.</li>
               <li><strong>Route cables behind the motherboard tray:</strong> Most PC cases have space behind the motherboard tray for cable management. Take advantage of this space by routing the cables behind the tray. This keeps them out of sight and creates a cleaner look. To prevent cables from interfering with the components, use the cable tie mounts often found in PC cases to secure the cables to the side of the case</li>
                <li><strong>Utilize cable management holes:</strong> PC cases usually have cable management holes or grommets strategically placed throughout the case. Make use of these holes to route the cables from one side of the case to the other. This not only keeps the cables organized but also prevents them from obstructing the airflow inside the case, which helps with cooling.</li>
                 <li><strong>Arrange cables for optimal airflow:</strong> Proper airflow is crucial for keeping your PC components cool. Ensure that the cables are arranged in a way that doesn't block the fans or impede the airflow. Keep the cables away from the CPU cooler and any other heat-producing components. This will help maintain lower temperatures and improve the overall performance of your PC.</li>
                  <li><strong>Consider using cable combs or clips:</strong> Cable combs or clips are handy accessories that help align and organize cables neatly. They hold the cables together in parallel, preventing them from overlapping or tangling. Cable combs can be attached to the motherboard or case, and they come in different sizes to accommodate different cable thicknesses.</li>
                   <li><strong>Avoid excessive cable length:</strong> Excess cable length can make cable management more challenging and disrupt airflow. To keep it neat, bundle up the excess cable length using cable ties or Velcro straps. Simply fold the cable back and tie it securely to avoid it getting in the way or obstructing other components.</li>
                   <li><strong>Test before finalizing:</strong> After tidying up the cables, it's important to test the system before finalizing everything. Ensure all connections are secure and the PC boots up properly. This is crucial to identify any loose connections or potential issues that may have occurred during the cable management process.</li>
