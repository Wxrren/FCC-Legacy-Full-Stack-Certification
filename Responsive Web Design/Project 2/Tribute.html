            <h2>The life of Dr J. Robert Oppenheimer</h2>
            <p>J. Robert Oppenheimer, born on April 22, 1904, in New York City was an American theoretical physicist and one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. 
He is best known for his role as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project during World War II, which led to the development of the first atomic bomb. Oppenheimer's brilliance, leadership, and dedication to scientific research played a pivotal role in the successful creation of the bomb, ultimately changing the course of history. However, his involvement in the project also raised ethical and moral concerns, as he grappled with the implications of nuclear weapons and their devastating potential. Despite facing challenges later in life, Oppenheimer's contributions to science and his impact on the nuclear age remain an enduring legacy in the scientific community.</p>
            <h3>5 Facts About Oppenheimer:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Oppenheimer struggled with his mental health in his younger years.</strong> While J. Robert Oppenheimer is often remembered for his brilliance as a physicist, just like anyone else he also experienced struggles with mental health in his younger years and throughout his life. During his early academic life, Oppenheimer battled with feelings of inadequacy and anxiety, leading to bouts of depression. Understanding his early battles with mental health helps humanise Oppenheimer, this should show us that even great minds can grapple with personal difficulties along their journey to success. </li>
         <li><strong>In his early years</strong>, J. Robert Oppenheimer released an astonishing number of scientific papers. These helped showcase his exceptional intellect and dedication to research even from a young age. His contributions spanned a wide range of fields, laying the foundation for his later groundbreaking work in nuclear physics and ultimately leading to his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb.</li>
<li><strong>At the age of 22</strong>, Oppenheimer alongside Max Born published many important contributions to the then newly developed quantum theory, most notably a famous paper on the so-called Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which separates nuclear motion from electronic motion in the mathematical treatment of molecules. Oppenheimer was able to secure a PH.D. at just 22!</li>
<li><strong>Oppenheimer became credited</strong> with being a founding father of the American school of theoretical physics. During this time he did important research in astrophysics, nuclear physics, spectroscopy and quantum field theory. He made important contributions to the theory of cosmic ray showers, and did work that eventually led toward descriptions of quantum tunneling. In the 1930s, he was the first to write papers suggesting the existence of what we call black holes in the modern day.</li>
<li><strong>Oppenheimer and Einstein</strong> officially became colleagues at the Institute for Advanced Study, where they worked side by side until Einstein's death in 1955. Despite occasionally having opposing views, Oppenheimer and Einstein were pretty much friends. Oppenheimer later reflected on his relationship with Einstein saying: "Though I knew Einstein for two or three decades, it was only in the last decade of his life that we were close colleagues and something of friends." </li>
